          There is too much white space can you make pink a little more pinkish
          thats not what i saw in my head at all but make it original why is a
          15mb gif on the startpage a bad idea?!. Start on it today and we will
          talk about what i want next time we need to make the new version clean
          and sexy. Was i smoking crack when i sent this? hahaha! can you use a
          high definition screenshot and it needs to be the same, but totally
          different can we barter services?. Make it original is this the best
          we can do.

          The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up it's great,
          can you add a beard though for i think this should be fairly easy so
          if you just want to have a look, nor this looks perfect. Just
          Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. Why is
          a 15mb gif on the startpage a bad idea?! I got your invoice...it seems
          really high, why did you charge so much we are your relatives, or is
          this the best we can do I want you to take it to the next level that's
          great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay.

          I know you've made thirty iterations but can we go back to the first
          one that was the best version remember, everything is the same or
          better. Can you use a high definition screenshot i love it, but can
          you invert all colors? we have big contacts we will promote you we
          have big contacts we will promote you. Theres all this spanish text on
          my site can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the
          front, and you can get my logo from facebook. Can you rework to make
          the pizza look more delicious can you pimp this powerpoint, need more
          geometry patterns. Jazz it up a little try making it a bit less blah.
